This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, the application must be built so that the pre-build scripts can be executed and all PWA files & data set up.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

Second, run the development server or the production build:

```bash
npm run dev
# or npm start
yarn dev
# or yarn start
pnpm dev
# or pnpm start
```
